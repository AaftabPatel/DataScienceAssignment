      "source": "Most machine learning algorithms assume that all misclassification errors made by a model are equal.\n\nThis is often not the case for imbalanced classification problems where missing a positive or minority class case is worse than incorrectly classifying an example from the negative or majority class. There are many real-world examples, such as detecting spam email, diagnosing a medical condition, or identifying fraud. In all of these cases, a false negative (missing a case) is worse or more costly than a false positive.\n\nCost-sensitive learning is a subfield of machine learning that takes the costs of prediction errors (and potentially other costs) into account when training a machine learning model. It is a field of study that is closely related to the field of imbalanced learning that is concerned with classification on datasets with a skewed class distribution. As such, many conceptualizations and techniques developed and used for cost-sensitive learning can be adopted for imbalanced classification problems.",
